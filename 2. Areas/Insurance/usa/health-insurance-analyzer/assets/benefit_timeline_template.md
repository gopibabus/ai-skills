## COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Front-Load Preventive Care
- Schedule all free preventive services in Q1
- Sets healthy baseline for the year
- Identifies any issues early

### Strategy 2: Strategic Procedure Timing
**If deductible NOT yet met:**
- Postpone non-urgent procedures if possible
- Accumulate toward deductible with necessary care first

**If deductible IS met:**
- Schedule elective procedures before year-end
- You'll pay coinsurance only

**If close to OOP max:**
- Consider accelerating planned procedures
- After OOP max, additional services are FREE

### Strategy 3: Prescription Optimization
- Switch to generic when available
- Use mail-order for 90-day supplies (usually cheaper)
- Check if switching to preferred brand saves money

### Strategy 4: Year-End Push
- Q4 is time to use remaining limited visits
- Don't let unused benefits expire
- Max out tax-advantaged accounts (FSA/HSA)
